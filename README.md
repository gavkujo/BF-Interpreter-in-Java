<h5 align="center">This is a small BrainF*ck (B.F.) interpreter i wrote (with some help from the internet) in Java.</h3>
<h5> Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.<br></h5>

## Commands used in B.F.

-   [ ] > : move pointer to next cell
-   [ ] < : move pointer to previous cell
-   [ ] + : increment byte at cell
-   [ ] - : decrement byte at cell
-   [ ] . : output ASCII value of byte at cell
-   [ ] , : take input and store value in bytes at cell
-   [ ] \[ : If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching \] command.
-   [ ] \] : If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching \[ command.
